# npm public feedback discussions

> Current Status: Private Beta Preview

In this repository, you can find the [official npm public feedback discussions](https://github.com/npm/feedback/discussions) for every part of npm including the cli, documentation, the registry, and the website.

These discussions are where you can share suggestions for how the products should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the npm product team. Check out [Making Suggestions](#making-suggestions) to learn how to provide feedback.

This feedback process is heavily influenced by the [official GitHub public feedback discussions](https://github.com/github/feedback). Thank you to the team who worked on that for paving the path!

## Making suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/npm/feedback/discussions) if you have suggestions for how we can improve npm. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion. We are hoping to foster productive and collaborative conversations, so please check out [how to give good feedback](https://github.com/npm/feedback/discussions/7) if you want some guidance on how to kick off a successful discussion.

Prior to making a new discussion please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already brought to our attention your suggestions. If you find a similar discussion reply with additional details or react to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion.

### From a suggestion to a shipped feature

Once you kick off a discussion the npm team will do our best to make an initial response within 7 days. From there, we will work with you, and the entire community, to ensure we understand the current capabilities npm doesn’t have and explore the space for potential solutions to your problem statement:

* If the npm team determines that we are going to prioritize a feature to solve the problem you've identified we will open an issue and track it's development in the public roadmap.
* If the npm team determines that we will not be working to solve the problem you have identified we will open an issue describing our reasoning so our decisions can remain transparent.
